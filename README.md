Project: Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

Link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/forms#project-1-bare-metal-forms-and-helpers

This solution contains a working form using bare html, a working form using form_tag helper and a working form using form_for helper.

This solution also contains editing functionality as well as error handling.

I then added some of my own functionality to improve usability.

**EXTRAS:**

I got tired of going to "locolahost:3000/users/new" to create a new user, so I added a "new user" link to the index page. Each entry has a link to edit it.

Typically you would edit an entry by going to the following address: "localhost:3000/users/1/edit" where 1 is the id of the entry you would like to edit, but now you can just click the links on the index page.

I would like to also thank JBerczel for his great walkthrough. See: http://jberczel.github.io/forms-walkthrough/ if you get really stuck.
